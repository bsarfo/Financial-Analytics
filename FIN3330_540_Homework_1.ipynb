    "# Financial Analytics - Homework 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructor: Shane Gao\n",
    "\n",
    ">**STOP: DO NOT begin working on this assignment until you have thoroughly reviewed the lecture notebooks for Module 01 and Module 02.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**General Instructions & Guidelines**\n",
    "1. Format and Structure\n",
    "    - **Follow Class Examples:** Review the coding structures and standards discussed in class; your submission should mirror that format as closely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Step-by-Step Implementation:** Break down each problem into multiple logical steps (e.g., Acquisition, Preprocessing, Analysis, Visualization) and write your code in a separate code cell for each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Clear and Commented Code:** Write your code in a clear, readable form. Provide detailed comments explaining the \"why\" behind your technical choices (e.g., why a specific method was chosen over other alternatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Output and Interpretation \n",
    "    - **Successful Execution:** Ensure your code runs successfully through all cells and generates the required results, including text summaries, numerical values, and professionally formatted figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Discussions (CRITICAL!!!):** Use `markdown` cells to provide your interpretation of the generated results. Link your findings to economic and financial concepts (e.g., market trends, risks, or economic shocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Grading Warning:** A question that contains only code and outputs without a written discussion will receive zero points. The interpretation of the data is as important as the implementation itself, if not more.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Submission Requirements\n",
    "    - **Testing:** Before submitting, select `Restart & Run All Cells` in your IDE environment to ensure all code runs from top to bottom successfully and produces the desired results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Environment Management:** Ensure your `.env` file containing API keys is handled correctly as per the security guidelines discussed in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Packaging:** Compress your entire Homework folder (including the notebook, any local data files, and saved images) into a single `.zip` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Submission to Canvas:** Upload the `zip` file as an attachment to the corresponding assignment link on Canvas.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Treat this notebook as a Professional Technical Report. Your goal is to lead the reader through your discovery process, demonstrating both your technical proficiency in programming and your analytical understanding of financial market dynamics.**"
